	<h1>Second Sphere: Mercury â€” The Ambitious</h1>

	<p>Because of its proximity to the sun, the planet Mercury is often difficult to see. Allegorically, the planet represents those who did good out of a desire for fame, but who, being ambitious, were deficient in the virtue of justice. Their earthly glory pales into insignificance beside the glory of God, just as Mercury pales into insignificance beside the sun. Here Dante meets the Emperor Justinian, who introduces himself with the words "Caesar I was and am Justinian," indicating that his personality remains, but that his earthly status no longer exists in Heaven (Canto V). Justinian recounts the history of the Roman Empire, mentioning, among others, Julius Caesar and Cleopatra; and bemoans the present state of Italy, given the conflict between Guelphs and Ghibellines, and the involvement of the "yellow lilies" of France (Canto VI):</p>

	<p>For some oppose the universal emblem with yellow lilies; others claim that emblem for party: it is hard to see who is worse.</p>

	<p>Let Ghibellines pursue their undertakings beneath another sign, for those who sever this sign and justice are bad followers.</p>

	<p>By association, Beatrice discourses on the Incarnation and the Crucifixion of Christ, which occurred during Roman times (Canto VII).</p>
