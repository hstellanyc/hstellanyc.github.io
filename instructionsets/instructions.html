	<p>1) Create a new document with six sections, three by two, that cover the entire page. (Two rows and three columns)</p>
	<p>2) On mobile, make it two by three. (Three rows and two columns)</p>
	<p>3) Make the chart have a black border around all boxes (including the overall chart itself).</p>
	<p>4) Each box should have either the word "Truth" or "Lie". Truths and lies cannot be placed next to eachother on the desktop screen. However on mobile, this does not matter.</p>
	<p>5) Center the words in the box.</p>
	<p>6) Give a WARM background color to the boxes that have the word "Truth".</p>
	<p>7) Give a COOL background color to the boxes that have the word "Lie".</p>
	<p>8) Choose a comic typeface you feel like is playful and apply this to the words.</p>
	<p>9) All Truths should be written in white and all Lies should be written in black.</p>
	<p>10) Lastly, make the color of the words "Truth" and "Lie" blink black & white. But  truths and lies cannot be the same shade at the same time as they blink.</p>
