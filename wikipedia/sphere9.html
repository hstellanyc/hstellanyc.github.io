	<h1>Ninth Sphere: The Primum Mobile â€” The Angels</h1>

	<p>The Primum Mobile ("first moved" sphere) is the last sphere of the physical universe. It is moved directly by God, and its motion causes all the spheres it encloses to move (Canto XXVII):</p>

	<p>This heaven has no other where than this: the mind of God, in which are kindled both the love that turns it and the force it rains.</p>

	<p>As in a circle, light and love enclose it, as it surrounds the rest and that enclosing, only He who encloses understands.</p>

	<p>No other heaven measures this sphere's motion, but it serves as the measure for the rest,even as half and fifth determine ten;</p>

	<p>The Primum Mobile is the abode of angels, and here Dante sees God as an intensely bright point of light surrounded by nine rings of angels (Canto XXVIII). Beatrice explains the creation of the universe, and the role of the angels, ending with a forceful criticism of the preachers of the day (Canto XXIX):</p>

	<p>Christ did not say to his first company: 'Go, and preach idle stories to the world'; but he gave them the teaching that is truth,</p>

	<p>and truth alone was sounded when they spoke; and thus, to battle to enkindle faith, the Gospels served them as both shield and lance.</p>

	<p>But now men go to preach with jests and jeers, and just as long as they can raise a laugh, the cowl puffs up, and nothing more is asked.</p>

	<p>But such a bird nests in that cowl, that if the people saw it, they would recognize as lies the pardons in which they confide.</p>
