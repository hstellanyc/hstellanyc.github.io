	<h1>Seventh Sphere: Saturn â€” The Contemplatives</h1>

	<p>The sphere of Saturn is that of the contemplatives, who embody temperance. Dante here meets Peter Damian, and discusses with him monasticism, the doctrine of predestination, and the sad state of the Church (Cantos XXI and XXII). Beatrice, who represents theology, becomes increasingly lovely here, indicating the contemplative's closer insight into the truth of God:</p>

	<p>She did not smile. Instead her speech to me began: Were I to smile, then you would be like Semele when she was turned to ashes,</p>

	<p>because, as you have seen, my loveliness which, even as we climb the steps of this eternal palace, blazes with more brightness</p>

	<p>were it not tempered here, would be so brilliant that, as it flashed, your mortal faculty would seem a branch a lightning bolt has cracked.</p>
