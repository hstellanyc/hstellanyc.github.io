	<h1>Third Sphere: Venus â€” The Lovers</h1>

	<p>The planet Venus (the Morning and Evening Star) is traditionally associated with the Goddess of Love, and so Dante makes this the planet of the lovers, who were deficient in the virtue of temperance (Canto VIII):</p>

	<p>The world, when still in peril, thought that, wheeling, in the third epicycle, Cyprian the fair sent down her rays of frenzied love,</p>

	<p>... and gave the name of her with whom I have begun this canto, to the planet that is courted by the sun, at times behind her and at times in front.</p>

	<p>Dante meets Charles Martel of Anjou, who was known to him, and who points out that a properly functioning society requires people of many different kinds. Such differences are illustrated by Cunizza da Romano (lover of Sordello), who is here in Heaven, while her brother Ezzelino III da Romano is in Hell, among the violent of the seventh circle.</p>

	<p>The troubadour Folquet de Marseilles speaks of the temptations of love, and points out that (as was believed at the time) the cone of the Earth's shadow just touches the sphere of Venus. He condemns the city of Florence (planted, he says, by Satan) for producing that "damned flower" (the florin) which is responsible for the corruption of the Church, and he criticises the clergy for their focus on money, rather than on Scripture and the writings of the Church Fathers (Canto IX):</p>

	<p>Your city, which was planted by that one who was the first to turn against his Maker, the one whose envy cost us many tears</p>

	<p>produces and distributes the damned flower that turns both sheep and lambs from the true course, for of the shepherd it has made a wolf.</p>

	<p>For this the Gospel and the great Church Fathers are set aside and only the Decretals are studied as their margins clearly show.</p>

	<p>On these the pope and cardinals are intent. Their thoughts are never bent on Nazareth, where Gabriel's open wings were reverent.</p>
