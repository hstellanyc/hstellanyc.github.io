	<h1>Fifth Sphere: Mars â€” The Warriors of the Faith</h1>

	<p>The planet Mars is traditionally associated with the God of War, and so Dante makes this planet the home of the warriors of the Faith, who gave their lives for God, thereby displaying the virtue of fortitude. The millions of sparks of light that are the souls of these warriors form a Greek cross on the planet Mars, and Dante compares this cross to the Milky Way (Canto XIV):</p>

	<p>As, graced with lesser and with larger lights between the poles of the world, the Galaxy gleams so that even sages are perplexed;</p>

	<p>so, constellated in the depth of Mars, those rays described the venerable sign a circle's quadrants form where they are joined.</p>

	<p>Dante says that sages are "perplexed" by the nature of the Milky Way, but in his Convivio, he had described its nature fairly well:</p>

	<p>What Aristotle said on this matter cannot be known with certainty. In the Old Translation he says that the Galaxy is nothing but a multitude of fixed stars in that region, so small that we are unable to distinguish them from here below, though from them originates the appearance of that brightness which we call the Galaxy; this may be so, for the heaven in that region is denser, and therefore retains and throws back this light. Avicenna and Ptolemy seem to share this opinion with Aristotle.</p>

	<p>Dante meets his ancestor Cacciaguida, who served in the Second Crusade. Cacciaguida praises the twelfth-century Republic of Florence, and bemoans the way in which the city has declined since those days (Cantos XV and XVI). The setting of the Divine Comedy in the year 1300, before Dante's exile, has allowed characters in the poem to "foretell" bad things for Dante. In response to a question from Dante, Cacciaguida speaks the truth bluntly. Dante will be exiled (Canto XVII):</p>

	<p>You shall leave everything you love most dearly: this is the arrow that the bow of exile shoots first. You are to know the bitter taste</p>

	<p>of others' bread, how salt it is, and know how hard a path it is for one who goes descending and ascending others' stairs.</p>

	<p>However, Cacciaguida also charges Dante to write and tell the world all that he has seen of Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven. Finally, Dante sees some other warriors of the Faith, such as Joshua, Judas Maccabeus, Charlemagne, Roland, and Godfrey of Bouillon (Canto XVIII).</p>
